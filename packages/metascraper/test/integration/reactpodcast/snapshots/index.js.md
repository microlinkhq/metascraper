      description: `Tom Preston-Werner is building a full-stack framework for React and GraphQL developers.␊
      In this episode we talk about RedwoodJS, a framework that’s bringing full-stack to Jamstack. Tom is a co-founder of GitHub, creator of Jekyll (the OG static site generator), TOML, and Semantic Versioning. If you’ve been hunting for a full-stack React and GraphQL solution, and envy the integration of frameworks like Rails and Laravel, listen up, because RedwoodJS might just be for for you.`,
