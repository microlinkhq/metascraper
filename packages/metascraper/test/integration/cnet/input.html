      "articleBody": "Editors' note, December 7, 2016: Pebble has announced that its assets have been acquired by Fitbit and it will no longer release new products. While the Pebble 2 and other Pebble watches will continue to work, no new software updates or features will be released. Pebble also warned that down the road functionality or service quality may be reduced. Kickstarter backers of the Pebble Time 2 and Pebble Core will receive a full refund for their purchase. Pebble's back with more smartwatches...and something else.Good news if you were a fan of Pebble's formula for smartwatches: There are two new watches on their way this September. They're more affordable, look better and have added heart rate tracking. The Pebble 2 and Pebble Time 2 hit Kickstarter today. But there's another thing coming early next year, called Pebble Core, that's not a watch at all.It's a box. A clip-on. A keychain. A smart button. A Spotify music player. A GPS and even 3G-enabled fitness tracker. An emergency gadget-slash-Pebble accessory. A programmable Android mini-computer.And it doesn't even have a screen.I got a chance to look at both at Pebble's headquarters in Redwood City, California, while talking with CEO Eric Migicovsky about why he's decided to move beyond the wrist for the first time.Pebble Core: A little do-it-all smart button box-slash-music player-slash-fitness thingMigicovsky has believed in fitness on smartwatches since the Pebble first launched. The campaign video for the Kickstarter campaign of the first Pebble Watch in 2012 focused on running, cycling and swim tracking. Migicovsky is a fitness addict. He's also casual. He met with me wearing a t-shirt, cargo shorts and flip-flops.Pebble watches run their own operating system, and have their own unique advantages compared to other watches in the ever-more-crowded wearable world. They have always-on reflective displays, week-plus battery life and better water resistance. But they're also less feature-rich than Android Wear, Apple Watch and Samsung's Gear S2. For instance, they can't directly play music.The Core feels like a bundle of smartwatch features all put into a separate kinda-sorta accessory. It has 4GB of storage and dedicated Spotify support to download music playlists (or, even stream over cellular wireless connection once a 3G SIM card is popped in), it has GPS and it has two touch surfaces that act as buttons, which can be programmed for anything from hailing an Uber to sending an emergency text SOS. Or, opening a smart lock. \"In some ways it's a computer on your keychain,\" says Migicovsky.It's small, it's plastic. And it looks more like a pebble than anything Pebble's made before.\"I love running with Pebble, but at the same time, I end up taking my phone because I like to listen to Spotify when I run and I like GPS for tracking,\" explains Migicovsky. \"And we looked at it and we looked at integrating it all into a watch. And we decided to actually create a secondary device, something that clips on to your waist belt or you can put in your pocket.\"\"We built it because we got feedback from our users that said they didn't want to run with their phone,\" says Migicovsky. In that sense, Pebble Core is almost like part of a high-end 3G GPS-enabled smartwatch like the Samsung Gear S2 3G, peeled off and turned into its own device.I couldn't try Pebble Core. It was just a screenless box I held for a few minutes. I was told it runs Android, but I couldn't tell how, or in what way. But Migicovsky proudly promises the Pebble Core is \"hackable\", meaning you can install apps and program its buttons in a variety of ways. (\"You can write apps in JavaScript for it,\" he explains, \"they could store it on here.\") There's even a mounting input on the back, if you take off the magnetic loop that normally clips onto a belt or keyring. Pebble Core could be a super-smart version of a Tile thing-finder, or simply a music player (it has a headphone jack and Bluetooth) and GPS-connected fitness tracker. It connects with a Pebble watch, or it can work alone. And at just $69 for its Kickstarter price (about \u00a350 or AU$100 converted) it may well be the wireless-headphone-friendly, Spotify-capable iPod Shuffle replacement that many runners have long dreamed of. Battery life lasts for up to 9 hours of music playback with GPS enabled, or for days on standby. And the Core charges wirelessly using the popular Qi standard, unlike Pebble's watches that use their own custom charge cables. Migicovsky sees a future where many little wearable devices work together all over your body, not just on the wrist: \"I see a future where at some point you're gonna have multiple wearables that all talk to each other, that connect through the Internet.\" Pebble Core is clearly aiming to take a first bite of it. Pebble watches with heart rate are closer to Fitbit than everThe watches are coming in September and fit a far clearer need. They're both distinct, affordably priced improvements to existing Pebble watches. And they both come closer to being full-fledged fitness trackers.Most notably, they both have optical heart rate tracking via a little bump on the back where continuous heart rate readings are measured on-wrist once every 10 minutes, or continuously during exercise.The Pebble 2 is a reboot of the very first black and white plastic Pebble, redone with a Gorilla Glass-covered black and white display and a slim, clean look. It has a microphone, just like the Pebble Time, for voice responses to messages. It's 30-meter water resistant. It costs just $129. (That converts to about \u00a390 or AU$180.)Pebble Time 2 gets rid of any distinction between the plastic Pebble Time and its better all-steel model. This is basically the Time Steel with heart rate tracking and a 50 percent larger color screen, at a lower $199 price (that converts to about \u00a3135 or AU$275). Both watches are compatible with the same magnetic chargers, and Pebble's embryonic smart strap system, which allows bands to attach to the rear charge port to access data and power. One year later, and smart straps still seem more like a promise than a reality, with only a few Kickstarter-type concepts in existence. Migicovsky still says Pebble doesn't plan to make any itself. \"Our smart strap strategy is very much about enabling and helping the community get these to market. We're a small company, we're focused on making the watches and the Core. That's the main focus for us. We see that the community is already starting to build these great accessories.\"Other than a larger, color display and better battery -- the Pebble 2 gets around 7 days of battery life, the larger Pebble Time 2 should get 10, according to Migicovsky -- these work the same. I'd probably go for the smaller, more affordable Pebble 2. It reminds me of a new-age Casio watch. I think it's the best-looking option.Much like last year, early Kickstarter adopters get discounts on both watches: $99 for Pebble 2, $169 for Pebble Time 2. Despite last year's somewhat controversial Kickstarter-first launch of Pebble Time, the same thing's happening again this year. According to Migicovsky, it's to satisfy the Kickstarter community that supported Pebble in the first place.Pebble's OS is also getting an update with some useful additions:                    Quick-peek notifications now pop below the watch face much like they do on Android Wear or Apple Watch, instead of taking over the whole screen.Actions, which are basically programmable quick functions that can do specific tasks faster. Checking weather, calling an Uber, or doing one-function things can be assigned to the Pebble buttons, or pulled out of a list-like menu.Migicovsky quotes the refrain that repeats throughout wearable tech: It's still too slow, and \"3 to 5 seconds\" is the goal for any interaction. \"It still takes too many clicks to navigate through the app list and dive all the way into an app. And when in reality, you've got your phone. If you're gonna spend more than 5 or 10 seconds on your watch, then you might as well take out your phone.\"How much more room is there on the wrist...or anywhere else?Shipments of wearable tech keep rising, but Pebble's position in smartwatches seems to be in flux. Recent wearable market estimates that include fitness trackers don't even have Pebble in the top 5.With Apple, Google, Samsung, Fitbit and a ton of other traditional watch companies like Fossil heading into the mix, Pebble might have a rough time gaining ground.

                      <p>Migicovsky has believed in fitness on smartwatches
                        since the Pebble first launched. The campaign video for

                        and swim tracking. Migicovsky is a fitness addict. He's

                        and better water resistance. But they're also less

                        put into a separate kinda-sorta accessory. It has 4GB of
                        storage and dedicated Spotify support to download music
                        playlists (or, even stream over cellular wireless
                        connection once a 3G SIM card is popped in), it has GPS
                        and it has two touch surfaces that act as buttons, which
                        can be programmed for anything from hailing an Uber to
                        sending an emergency text SOS. Or, opening a smart lock.
                        "In some ways it's a computer on your keychain," says
                        Migicovsky.</p>
                      <p>It's small, it's plastic. And it looks more like a
                        pebble than anything Pebble's made before.</p>

                      <p>"I love running with Pebble, but at the same time, I
                        end up taking my phone because I like to listen to
                        Spotify when I run and I like GPS for tracking,"
                        explains Migicovsky. "And we looked at it and we looked
                        at integrating it all into a watch. And we decided to
                        actually create a secondary device, something that clips
                        on to your waist belt or you can put in your pocket."
                      </p>
                      <p>"We built it because we got feedback from our users
                        that said they didn't want to run with their phone,"
                        says Migicovsky. In that sense, Pebble Core is almost
                        like part of a high-end 3G GPS-enabled smartwatch like

                      <p>I couldn't try Pebble Core. It was just a screenless
                        box I held for a few minutes. I was told it runs
                        Android, but I couldn't tell how, or in what way. But
                        Migicovsky proudly promises the Pebble Core is
                        "hackable", meaning you can install apps and program its
                        buttons in a variety of ways. ("You can write apps in
                        JavaScript for it," he explains, "they could store it on
                        here.") There's even a mounting input on the back, if
                        you take off the magnetic loop that normally clips onto
                        a belt or keyring. </p>

                        or simply a music player (it has a headphone jack and
                        Bluetooth) and GPS-connected fitness tracker. It
                        connects with a Pebble watch, or it can work alone. And
                        at just $69 for its Kickstarter price (about £50 or
                        AU$100 converted) it may well be the
                        wireless-headphone-friendly, Spotify-capable iPod
                        Shuffle replacement that many runners have long dreamed
                        of. Battery life lasts for up to 9 hours of music
                        playback with GPS enabled, or for days on standby. And
                        the Core charges wirelessly using the popular Qi
                        standard, unlike Pebble's watches that use their own
                        custom charge cables. </p>
                      <p>Migicovsky sees a future where many little wearable
                        devices work together all over your body, not just on
                        the wrist: "I see a future where at some point you're
                        gonna have multiple wearables that all talk to each
                        other, that connect through the Internet." Pebble Core
                        is clearly aiming to take a first bite of it. </p>

                      <h3>Pebble watches with heart rate are closer to Fitbit
                        than ever</h3>
                      <p>The watches are coming in September and fit a far
                        clearer need. They're both distinct, affordably priced
                        improvements to existing Pebble watches. And they both
                        come closer to being full-fledged fitness trackers.</p>
                      <p>Most notably, they both have optical heart rate
                        tracking via a little bump on the back where continuous
                        heart rate readings are measured on-wrist once every 10
                        minutes, or continuously during exercise.</p>
                      <p>The Pebble 2 is a reboot of the very first black and
                        white <a

                          Pebble</a>, redone with a Gorilla Glass-covered black
                        and white display and a slim, clean look. It has a
                        microphone, just like the Pebble Time, for voice
                        responses to messages. It's 30-meter water resistant. It
                        costs just $129. (That converts to about £90 or AU$180.)
                      </p>
                      <p>Pebble Time 2 gets rid of any distinction between the

                          href="https://www.cnet.com/products/pebble-time-steel/">all-steel
                          model</a>. This is basically the Time Steel with heart
                        rate tracking and a 50 percent larger color screen, at a
                        lower $199 price (that converts to about £135 or
                        AU$275). Both watches are compatible with the same
                        magnetic chargers, and Pebble's embryonic smart strap
                        system, which allows bands to attach to the rear charge
                        port to access data and power. </p>
                      <p>One year later, and smart straps still seem more like a

                        in existence. Migicovsky still says Pebble doesn't plan
                        to make any itself. "Our smart strap strategy is very
                        much about enabling and helping the community get these
                        to market. We're a small company, we're focused on
                        making the watches and the Core. That's the main focus
                        for us. We see that the community is already starting to
                        build these great accessories."</p>
                      <p>Other than a larger, color display and better battery
                        -- the Pebble 2 gets around 7 days of battery life, the
                        larger Pebble Time 2 should get 10, according to
                        Migicovsky -- these work the same. I'd probably go for
                        the smaller, more affordable Pebble 2. It reminds me of
                        a new-age Casio watch. I think it's the best-looking
                        option.</p>

                        get discounts on both watches: $99 for Pebble 2, $169
                        for Pebble Time 2. Despite last year's somewhat
                        controversial Kickstarter-first launch of Pebble Time,
                        the same thing's happening again this year. According to
                        Migicovsky, it's to satisfy the Kickstarter community
                        that supported Pebble in the first place.</p>

                      <p>Pebble's OS is also getting an update with some useful
                        additions:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Quick-peek notifications now pop below the watch
                          face much like they do on Android Wear or Apple Watch,
                          instead of taking over the whole screen.</li>
                        <li>Actions, which are basically programmable quick
                          functions that can do specific tasks faster. Checking
                          weather, calling an Uber, or doing one-function things
                          can be assigned to the Pebble buttons, or pulled out
                          of a list-like menu.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>Migicovsky quotes the refrain that repeats throughout
                        wearable tech: It's still too slow, and "3 to 5 seconds"
                        is the goal for any interaction. "It still takes too
                        many clicks to navigate through the app list and dive
                        all the way into an app. And when in reality, you've got
                        your phone. If you're gonna spend more than 5 or 10
                        seconds on your watch, then you might as well take out
                        your phone."</p>
