[...] all kind of entrepreneurs, whether they’re launching a taco truck or the next Google, can plug into the center for free classes, mentorship, media coaching, meeting space and other support.  The nonprofit center, located near the future Transbay Transit Center, is backed by $10 million from the Nasdaq Educational Foundation, the stock exchange’s 22-year-old  philanthropy arm.  Outside 505 Howard St., a Times-Square-style electronic ticker scrolls promotions for events and logos of corporate sponsors.  Inside, the expansive ground-floor space is divided into various functional areas: a state-of-the-art broadcast studio where budding Jack Dorseys or Marissa Mayers can learn how to handle on-camera interviews; classrooms that can accommodate dozens of people for hands-on trainings; a cafe and meeting space for collaborations; and a big lobby that serves double duty as space for pop-up shops to test products and ideas.

[...] that venture funding is tighter, it will offer tips on how to weather this period with alternative financing strategies, for instance.  The center hosted a two-day regional workshop for 1776’s Challenge Cup startup contest and helped it identify interesting entrepreneurs, mentors, coaches and local experts.",
